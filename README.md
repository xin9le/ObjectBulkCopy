A super simple C# library for performing [`SqlBulkCopy`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient.sqlbulkcopy) directly on your CLR objects. No need to manually map properties--just plug in your list of objects and copy them to SQL Server with minimal setup. Ideal for high-performance data inserts in .NET applications.
